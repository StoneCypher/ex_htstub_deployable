ex_htstub_deployable
====================

This is an example of an `htstub` deployable project.  It is kept as simple as possible.

Compile using the rebar command below, then start(), and you should have a hello world http server running on port 8812.





tl;dr
-----

`rebar g-d co eu doc`





Current Library Status: *Usable*
--------------------------------

This library is considered to be ready as an example of a workable htstub project.

It's also kind of ridiculously simple.

Improvements will be gladly accepted.
